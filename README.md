## What is Lanceur?

![Lanceur](./docs/assets/images/usermanual/search.png)

Lanceur is a lightweight and highly customizable application launcher built in .NET. Inspired by SlickRun, with features influenced by Wox and Flow Launcher, it helps you open applications, files, and web pages instantly—just type a shortcut and press ENTER.

I originally started Lanceur because I wanted to build my own project—something that carried my name and worked exactly the way I envisioned. I love SlickRun, but I wanted my own take on it, with a few differences that better suited my workflow. If others find it useful too, that’s a bonus!
