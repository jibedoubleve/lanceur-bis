# Lanceur Bis

## What is it?

This is a free adaptation of [Slickrun](https://bayden.com/slickrun/) written in .NET and with features inspired by [Wox](https://github.com/Wox-launcher/Wox).

It is also a rewriting of my project [Lanceur](https://github.com/jibedoubleve/lanceur)

## What does it do?

Make a list of shortcuts, configure them and earn a lot of time by just typing the shortcut and press ENTER
