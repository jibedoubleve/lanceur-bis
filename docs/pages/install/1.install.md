# Installation

Visit the release page [HERE](https://github.com/jibedoubleve/lanceur-bis/releases) and download the file `Lanceur.x.x.x.setup.exe`.

## SmartScreen Warning

This warning appears because the installer is new and has not yet been recognised by Microsoft. Rest assured, the software is open source and completely safe—you can review the source code here: [Source Code](https://github.com/jibedoubleve/lanceur-bis).

To proceed, click **"More info"** and then **"Run anyway."** (1)

## Choose How You Want the App to Run at Startup

- 1️⃣ **Start the application via a scheduled task** (⚠️ Experimental Feature): The installer will create a scheduled task that launches Lanceur when the user logs in. *Note: This method has a known issue where the application closes when the computer switches to battery power.*
- 2️⃣ **Start the application via the registry**: Lanceur will be added to the registry to start automatically at login.

> The scheduled task method is faster than the registry method because it runs with higher priority, bypasses startup delays, executes before Explorer loads, and avoids potential permission issues. However, due to the known issue with battery power, users may prefer the registry method for stability.
