## Macros

Macros are hidden keywords that can be activated by creating an alias with a specific text in the _File Name_ field.

To activate a macro:

1. Enter its name (including `@`) in the _File Name_ field.
2. Assign it a name.
3. Save the alias.

| Macro                 | Description                                                   | Parameters             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `@multi@`             | Executes a list of aliases.                                   | The alias serie        |
| `@guid@`              | Generates a GUID and copies it to the clipboard.              | N/A                    |
| `@clipboard_as_text@` | Clears formatting and copies only the plain text to clipboard | N/A                    |
| `@github_issue@`      | Creates new issue in Github for Lanceyr                       | The title of the issue |

### `@multi@` - Execute a List of Aliases in a Custom Order

Execute a list of alias in the order you configured it. In the parameters, add all the alias you want to launch and in the order you want to launch.

Each alias is separated by at least one `@` Each `@` will delay the execute of one second (If you want a bigger delay, add multiple `@`)

Example:

`alias1@@alias2@@@alias3`

This will run alias1, then wait 2 seconds before alias2, and 3 seconds before alias3.

@github_issue@ â€“ Create a new issue in the Lanceur-bis repository

Creates a new GitHub issue for the Lanceur-bis project. The parameter is the issue title.

To use this feature, you must have a token provided by someone with admin access to the repository.

Example

`<issue_alias> Bug: something is wrong`
