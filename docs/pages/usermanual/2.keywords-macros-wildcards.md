## Macros

Macros are hidden keywords that can be activated by creating an alias with a specific text in the _File Name_ field.

To activate a macro:

1. Enter its name (including `@`) in the _File Name_ field.
2. Assign it a name.
3. Save the alias.

| Macro                 | Description                                                   | Parameters             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `@multi@`             | Executes a list of aliases.                                   | The alias serie        |
| `@guid@`              | Generates a GUID and copies it to the clipboard.              | N/A                    |
| `@clipboard_as_text@` | Clears formatting and copies only the plain text to clipboard | N/A                    |
| `@github_issue@`      | Creates new issue in Github for Lanceyr                       | The title of the issue |

### `@multi@`

Execute a list of alias in the order you configured it. In the parameters, add all the alias you want to launch and in the order you want to launch.

Each alias is separated by at least one `@` Each `@` will delay the execute of one second (If you want a bigger delay, add multiple `@`)

### Configuration

#### `@multi@` - Execute a List of Aliases in a Custom Order

This feature allows you to execute a list of aliases in the exact order you specify. In the parameters, include all the aliases you wish to run, listed in the desired sequence.

Use the @ symbol to separate each alias. Each @ introduces a one-second delay before the next alias is executed. To add a longer delay, simply use multiple @ symbols.

Example:

`alias1@@alias2@@@alias3`

This will run alias1, then wait 2 seconds before alias2, and 3 seconds before alias3.

### `@github_issue@` - create a new issue in repository Lanceur-bis
