# Lua Scripting

## What does it do?

You can create a Lua script to run before the alias starts. The main purpose is to dynamically modify the _parameters_ or _file name_ of the alias, but you can use Lua for other tasks as well. Keep in mind that the script environment has no preloaded libraries—this is vanilla Lua.

## How to use it?

The script API is minimal (cf. below). You can **Dry run** the script to preview its behaviour. When you’re satisfied, click **Apply**. The script will only be saved to the database if you click **Save** on the main page.

### Description of `context`

Contains information about the script context. This can be updated within the script.

The main purpose of the scripting feature is to update the context. This context includes the following values:

| Property      | Purpose                                                                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FileName`    | The file name configured for this alias                                |
| `Parameters`  | The parameters the user has configured for this alias                  |
| `IsCancelled` | When set to `true`, the alias will not be executed. Otherwise, it will be executed normally |

### Description of `notification`

Provides a way to notify the user through the UI.

| Method                                   | Description              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `notification:Information("Hello world")` | Sends an **information** message |
| `notification:Warning("Hello world")`     | Sends a **warning** message     |
