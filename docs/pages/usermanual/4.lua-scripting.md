# Lua Scripting

## What does it do?

You can create a Lua script to run before the alias starts. The main purpose is to dynamically modify the _parameters_ or _file name_ of the alias, but you can use Lua for other tasks as well. Keep in mind that the script environment has no preloaded libraries—this is vanilla Lua.

## How to use it?

The script API is minimal. You have access to a `context` object with two properties: `Parameters` and `FileName` (**case sensitive**). You can **Dry run** the script to preview its behaviour. When you’re satisfied, click **Apply**. The script will only be saved to the database if you click **Save** on the main page.
