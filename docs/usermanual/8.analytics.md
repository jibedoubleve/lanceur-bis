# Analytics  

Lanceur uses a **SQLite** database to store important data such as aliases, configuration settings, and alias usage statistics. This database is stored locally by default in the `%appdata%\probel\lanceur2` directory, though you can reconfigure it to your preferred location.

The analytics section in the database tracks the following usage metrics:  
- **Aliases Launched per Year**  
- **Aliases Launched per Month**  
- **Aliases Launched per Day**  
- **Weekly Usage Trend**  
- **Daily Usage Trend**  
- **Hourly Usage Trend**

## The SQLite Database  

Since **Lanceur** is an open-source project, the database schema is publicly available. However, if you're curious about the structure, here's a visual representation of the database schema for your reference:
