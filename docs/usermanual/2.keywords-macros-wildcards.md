## Macros

Macros are hidden keywords that can be activated by creating an alias with a specific text in the _File Name_ field.

To activate a macro:

1. Enter its name (including `@`) in the _File Name_ field.
2. Assign it a name.
3. Save the alias.

| Macro     | Description                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `@multi@` | Executes a list of aliases.                      |
| `@guid@`  | Generates a GUID and copies it to the clipboard. |

### Configuration

#### `@multi@`

In the _Arguments_ field, list the aliases to execute, separating them with one or more `@` symbols. Each `@` represents a 1-second delay between executions.

## Replacement Cards

Any occurrence of these macros in the _File Name_ field will be replaced as follows:

| Card    | Description                                              |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **$C$** | Replaced with clipboard content, formatted for web URLs. |
| **$R$** | Replaced with raw clipboard content.                     |
| **$I$** | Replaced with typed parameters.                          |
| **$W$** | Replaced with typed parameters, formatted for web URLs.  |
