## How to Configure a Scheduled Task?  


If you encounter issues when setting up a scheduled task to start the application at logon, it may be due to the default task settings.  

### Solution  

You can resolve this issue by modifying the scheduled task settings:  

1. Open the Start menu and type **"Task Scheduler"**, then select the corresponding option.

3. Right-click on it and select **Properties**.

1. Go to the **Conditions** tab.  
2. Uncheck **"Start the task only if the computer is on AC power"**.  
3. Click **OK** to save the changes.  

This should ensure that the scheduled task runs correctly at logon.
